# EGD test solver "BROKEN"

In Russia there's a platform called MESH that has online tests.
Once I decided to create a semi-automated application that would solve these test.

After I finished the project I began testing it and it worked.
Two weeks later the 'MESH' test system was remade and now the application doesn't work.
I'm probably not going to try remaking the application for the new test system 
since I myself have no use for it.

I've also commited a .odt file containing the explanation on how the program worked.
